# Halo 5 Server Looking for Group

This project lets your Xbox act as a host for custom games in Halo 5.  
It uses SCP driver and the Windows 10 streaming feature to run custom games and 
sends out invites to players requesting to join by message with the command 'inv'.

# Run
Need SCP Driver installed

#TODO
1.  The timer values are wrong.  It needs investigation to figure out good values.
2.  Work on adding top forge maps and game modes.

#ROADMAP
1.  Add error detection by screen capturing the GPU front buffer and using image process or pixel detection to determine the state.
